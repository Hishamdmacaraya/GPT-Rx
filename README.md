GPT-Rx is an AI-driven tool that leverages the GPT-Neo 2.7B model to generate concise, detailed descriptions of medicines. Users simply input a medicine's generic name, and GPT-Rx provides information on its primary uses, dosage recommendations, and potential side effects.

> **Note:** This tool is for educational purposes only and is **not** a substitute for professional medical advice.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Descriptions:** Utilizes GPT-Neo 2.7B for generating detailed medicine information.  
- **Command-Line Interface:** Easy-to-use terminal application with minimal dependencies.  
- **Educational Demo:** Showcases how large language models can be applied to healthcare-related tasks.



## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPT-Rx.git
   cd GPT-Rx
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies:**

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then run:

   ```bash
   python gpt-rx.py
   ```

Follow the on-screen prompt to enter the generic name of a medicine, and GPT-Rx will generate a detailed description covering uses, dosage, and potential side effects.

## Usage

Run the application from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python gpt-rx.py
   ```

Follow the on-screen prompt to enter the generic name of a medicine, and GPT-Rx will generate a detailed description covering uses, dosage, and potential side effects.

## Demo
Below are two demos showing GPT-Rx in action.

## Future Improvements

1. **Fine-Tuned Models:** Integrate a medically fine-tuned language model for enhanced accuracy.
2. **Output Parsing:** Implement robust parsing to produce more structured, easily readable text.
3. **Enhanced UI:** Create a graphical interface or web-based front end for broader accessibility.
4. **Validation:** Cross-reference outputs with trusted medical resources for reliability.
